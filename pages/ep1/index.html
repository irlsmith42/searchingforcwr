                <p>VOICEVER (LEO):<strong> </strong>Have you ever been part of a “cult following”? A movie, TV show, a musician with a small, devoted fanbase? </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;"><em>[X-Files audio clip] FOX MULDER: Scully!</em></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">[X-Files theme plays]</p>
                <p>Maybe when you were a teenager, you had the “I Want to Believe” poster from the X-Files hanging up on your wall. [“Time Warp” plays.] Maybe once you went to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show live, stood in the crowd listening to the people scream along. [“Strange Attractor” by Superconducting Supercolliders plays.] Maybe there’s this niche band you like, or a podcast, something esoteric, with a certain secret logo, and sometimes you see the symbol on a stranger’s shirt or on a button passing by on the street. You look at them and quickly know something about them—nothing about their everyday life, their education, or their family—but something else, something important in a different way. </p>
                <p>Cause you’re both in the cult. </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">LEO: [interview] Tell me about the first time you ever heard the Superconducting Supercolliders.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">SASHA: Yes. Um (laughs) when we were working on the farm, uh, we would listen to a lot of like, podcasts while we were working, we would also listen to a lot of music...</p>
                <p>LEO: [VOICEOVER] The spring after I finished my first semester at art school, I went to volunteer on a little farm where my friend Sasha was working, up in British Columbia. We had graduated with our English degrees in December, and gone our separate ways — me, to Chicago, and her, to Vancouver Island to learn agricultural skills from a family of christian farmers that owned a small plot of land and 2,000 chickens. </p>
                <p>The farm was in the middle of the woods. To get there, I took a ferry, then a bus, then walked down a curvy two-lane forest road, passing by horses, a vineyard, a mountain vista, and an alpaca farm, but mostly, just pine trees.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">SASHA ...There was like a big chicken barn, and there were big fields, and lots and lots of tall grass, you'd have to stomp through the tall grass to get to the chicken barns. </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 4em;"><em>SASHA [phone video, 2018]: I’ve got my mask, I’ve got my egg carton things... and my phone’s about to get pecked by 2,000 chickens. This is one of the most difficult parts of my job...KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Hello.... [Deafening chicken sounds]</em></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">SASHA: ...Uh, and when I got there, the greenhouses were really barren, there wasn't much there, 11:44 but by the time you arrived, they were flourishing, and there were like huge kale pants that were as tall as we were that we would harvest from [...] Oh, and there was the 12:02 prophouse, where they would grow the baby plants, which was my favorite place on the farm cause it was so warm, and like smelled like dirt in there, and all the little baby shoots were coming up in there.</p>
                <p>LEO: When we were done with egg duty, we helped with the harvest, which meant filling orders for organic vegetables. In the greenhouse, we harvested arugula, lettuce, peppers, nasturtium... </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">Supercos “Sea of Dirac” + greenhouse enviro]</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">LEO: So, that was where you first heard the Superconducting Supercolliders.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">SASHA: Yes. Um (laughs) when we were working on the farm, uh, we would listen to a lot of like, podcasts while we were working, we would also listen to a lot of music, and sometimes, you would listen to music that I thought sounded very strange, uh, I didn't really know what it was, I didn't really like it very much, and uh... I teased you about it, cause I asked you what it was, and you said that it was uh a band that was singing songs from a Pacific Rim fanfiction. And I was like, (laughs) (Leo laughs) I was like, sorry, <em>what</em>? And I didn't know anything about CWR and I hadn't read Designations, um, 15:45 so, I yeah, I just remember, uh, not not particularly enjoying it at first. I think Supercos is an acquired taste, and I hadn’t acquired it yet. </p>
                <p>LEO: The Superconducting Supercolliders. The name of the band I was subjecting Sasha to while we squatted in the dirt, snipping lettuce with scissors. If you’ve ever introduced a band to someone with, “You’ve probably never heard of them before,” I raise you the Supercos. They never toured. They never played a concert. They were probably never even in the same room together. </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">[Song fades out]</p>
                <p>The band was invented by user CleanWhiteRoom as  a plot element in a story in 2013—a fanfiction for the movie <em>Pacific Rim</em>. <em>Pacific Rim,</em> if you’ve forgotten, was a summer 2013 blockbuster directed by Guillermo Del Toro, about giant robots fighting giant alien monsters in the Pacific. </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;"><em>Pacific Rim trailer clip] RALEIGH BECKET: When man and machine become one...</em></p>
                <p>So, fictional band. Real songs. Fictional band for a story, which was about a movie. </p>
                <p>The name of the story was “Designations Congruent with Things,” Designations for short. It’s an unusual story—it’s not at all like a conventional work of fanfiction, or, really, any conventional book I’ve read. It’s really long, and it’s really dense. Like, the language is really dense. </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">LEO: So how was Designations like, different from other fic that you had read?</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">LEAH: Probably the most immediate difference and I feel this is pretty regular, like a pretty common thing that people experience, is that um, the vocabulary is pretty dense. Um... a lot of people would say that they'd have to read it with Wikipedia open in the next tab.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">SASHA: I spent a lot of time googling um, names, mostly of mathematicians and scientists throughout history.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">KATE: So at one point I vividly remember having um Designations open in one tab on my computer and uh, like a google doc or you know, some other kind of notepad or something like that in another tab just so I could write down the words that I don't know and look up their definitions...</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">BRI: And then, I started reading it, and I was like "Who is this person, and how do they know so much?" </p>
                <p>But the author was anonymous. They were obviously very well-educated, but they were very private. They didn’t give any location, age, field, not even a gender pronoun. Nobody knew anything about them except their screen name: CleanWhiteRoom. </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">["Strange Attractor" plays] </p>
                <p>Designations was their underground hit. It was long—over 200,000 words, which translates to about 800 pages in a conventional book. And it was hard—it challenged the reader. Over the year-or-so span of 2013 to 2014, when it was posted, chapter by chapter, it gained a miniature cult following. </p>
                <p>People <em>loved </em>this story. It had thousands of comments, and a little fanbase of its own. By 2015, Designations had an audiobook adaptation, a 2-hour radio play spinoff, and yes, a band. They had two albums and two EPs. </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 2em;">[“Strange Attractor” swells...]</p>
                <p>[...and then cuts off abruptly.] And then one day, the author vanished from the internet. They scrubbed all their accounts, pulled all the stories down, and were never heard from again. </p>
